# TCN Demo

## What is it?
This is a simple time-server program written in Node.js as a demonstration of a generative AI technique I've code-named "TCN". This demo code was generated by an TCN program, in conjunction with ChatGPT. Commented out blocks were human refinement, but all code otherwise is generated. This is a technique for exploring semi-autonomous programming with LLMs.
